A bunch of [crazy people](https://github.com/orgs/osdc/members) who want to provide a space where developers and designers can hack, learn and collaborate. We believe in the spirit of open source and would like to spread it to as many people as we can.
OSDConf is our attempt in doing so. It's a 2 day event ( 26-26th April ) in Jaypee Institute of Information Technology ( Noida, New Delhi ). We have some proposed sessions and hack spaces.

OSDConf is an attempt by a bunch of crazy people to provide a space, where developers, designers and enthusiasts can learn, hack and collaborate with each other.
It's a 2 day event ( 26-27th April ) in Jaypee Institute of Information Technology ( Noida, New Delhi ), and the registration is free.



We are a bunch of [crazy people](https://github.com/orgs/osdc/members) who love to hack and collaborate. By obvious nature, we also love open source and have been contributing to it since we got introduced to it.

We love going to conferences and hackathons, meet new people, discuss thier workflows and hack with them to build something.

We have learned a lot from people who have pushed us forward, and want to do the same for other people, hence we decided to organize a small conference for people like us - **OSDConf**.

With help from zomato, Wikimedia, mozilla and GitHub we have been able to arrange this conference. Wether you are a beginner or a pro, it does not matter to us, as long as you are willing to learn and collaborate, there is definitely going to be something for you there.

The conference is on 24th April at Jaypee Institute of Information Technology [show on map](#). We have some [sessions]() already planned up, and if you want to give one of your own, [propose your session here](). If you are not the session kind of people, we have hackspaces for you.

That feeling that you get when you hit that *git push* command after gulping down your beer - If you know that feeling, you should definitely come over, but then again if you don't know the feeling, you should absolutely come over to know what it feels like.
